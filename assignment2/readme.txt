Hello! Today I will be explaining how my project works!



To be able to use it, firstly, you have to open http://localhost:3000/home in your local browser.
It will say, "This site canâ€™t be reached," because we have not started the server yet.
After that, you open Visual Studio File>Open Folder>Assignment2 and press "trust authors" to grant access.
After that, press "F5" in Windows or "FN" + "F5" in MacOS, and it will run the server locally on port 3000.
After that, refresh the localhost page and press "login."
For username, enter "admin" and password, "123."
After that, you will be redirected to http://localhost:3000/list.
From there, you have access to 25 user data points. You can see the full details of each user, or to see it more clearly, you can press on each of their IDs and see it.

Thank you for using it!
Feedback needed!
