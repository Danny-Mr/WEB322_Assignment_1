## Feeback

Hey Danny, there a few problems here.

1.  Code wasn't done in a branch.
2.  Naming convention was not followed.
3.  Lots of good ideas in the code but unfortunatley it does not output anything.

Please take a look at [this solution](https://github.com/bqchristie/seneca-web322-fall-2023/blob/main/assignments/temp.solution.one.js).

If you need help with Git or want to discuss the soltion more please see me after lab on Thursday.
